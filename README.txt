# Phone Upgrade Tool

Welcome! For more information visit the [complete documentation](./Docs/overview.md).

<!-- Brief introduction and how to get started -->

## Introduction
I needed to update my phone. The first issue that I ran into was the limited flexibility that many phone comparison
tools offer online. The second issue that I ran into was the lackluster ability that current public AI tools have for 
these sort of things, so I made a quick solution in Python for that.

## Features
<!-- List of features -->
It takes a phone and outputs a list of phones that are better than it ranked by price in US Dollars.


It compares: battery, ram memory , storage space, video quality, and screen resolution. Additionally, it has the option 
to compare OS versions and can even limit  results for the same original phone's OS.
